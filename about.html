          The Photo Store is a TRUE portrait studio that produces outstanding quality portraits at very reasonable 
          prices. Most families who chose The Photo Store are looking for something artistic and beautiful and 
          almost equally important, they are looking for an experience they can’t get anywhere else. 
          Our photographers are passionate about photography and that enables us to capture the moments 
          in your life that are so precious in truly unique ways. In addition, our photographers are trained 
          by a “master” photographer ensuring that the resulting images will be very special.

          A portrait, by definition, should portray. It should go beyond showing just a view of a face, 
          it should reveal the soul of the person. This is the goal we have for everyone who lays, sits, crawls 
          or stands before our camera - to bring out the inner beauty and personality - each of us has. 
          It might mean showing the closeness of a family, the bonding between Mother and Child, the innocence 
          of childhood or the purity of a newborn baby. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When we started our business in 1980, we aspired to 
          produce the finest photography we were capable of, without compromise. We have never regretted that 
          decision and neither have our clients. Quality does not go out of style. It costs less in the long 
          run, and is always appreciated by those who know the difference. You see---a portrait you truly 
          love is priceless---and one you hate is worthless!

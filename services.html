            Capturing and preserving the special beauty of your pregnancy is our goal at The Photo Store.
            We strive to capture in photographic art each woman’s natural beauty and expression. These
            touching and beautiful sessions are a wonderful way to preserve this very special time in your life.
            Our photographers will control the shadows and highlights within the maternity photographs to create
            visually sensitive silhouettes, elevating the unique lines of each pregnant woman’s body into
            an ultimately timeless work of photographic art. These sessions take place in a fun and relaxed
            atmosphere. Many people chose to include the father or even their children in this session as well.

            The Photo Store's Exclusive Baby Plan is for an entire year of photography!
            Our First Year Baby Plan Is So Simple, Yet You Get SO Much!
            With our Baby Plan, we photograph your baby at the remarkable ages newborn 3, 6, 9 12 months and
            first family portraits. You’ll be amazed with the images from each session! I guarantee it or your
            money back! You can’t lose. When you come in for your first session, you’ll have One HOUR of
            photography time scheduled JUST FOR YOU! It’s YOUR time, with no crying babies waiting in line.
            And it’s a fun time in a relaxed, comfortable camera room setting with soft baby music. We even
            have baby necessities in the dressing room should you have forgotten some or run out of supplies.
            If your baby gets fussy, needs fed, diaper changed, etc., we’ll simply take a break. It is because
            of this and our love of babies that you’ll end up with the most beautiful images you can imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now For The Exciting Part! At the end of the 12 month session, you’ll receive a 16” x 16” Canvas
            Gallery Wrap wall composite with 4 images on it (one from each of the 4 stages) and your baby’s
            name added to complete the look! What an incredible keepsake for you to treasure forever! A sample
            of the Boy's panel is shown. We have many styles to chose from to match your home décor. But, you
